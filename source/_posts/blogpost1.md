# Business Operations

## Description
My business is an Outpatient Medical Clinic that provides services for operation rooms, emergency rooms, private consultations, hospitalization, and more. The clinic leverages many tools, equipment, and supplies to conduct its operations. There are many events that depend on effective communication and accuracy. There are modules for client reservations, resource scheduling, patient tracking, surgery staff contact, and many others. 

## Areas of operation

### 1. **Reservation and Scheduling**: 
This will cover how the Surgical Center takes reservations from from a private doctor's medical team (a.k.a. "client Doctor") and schedules various resources, including operation rooms, emergency rooms, equipment, and staff. We will explore how to model these resources, their availability, and the scheduling mechanisms to ensure efficient use.

### 1. **Resource Management**: 
This will cover how the clinic manages various resources, including operation rooms, emergency rooms, equipment, and staff. We will explore how to model these resources, their availability, and the scheduling mechanisms to ensure efficient use.

### 2. **Patient Tracking and Records Management**: 
This involves managing patient information, from registration through treatment to discharge. We'll look into designing a system for securely storing and retrieving patient records, tracking patient progress, and integrating with other modules for seamless information flow.

### 3. **Doctor and Staff Communication**: 
Focusing on how to facilitate effective communication among doctors, nurses, and other staff. This includes designing a system for alerts, messaging, and information sharing that supports the clinic's operational flow and enhances coordination for patient care.

### 4. **Inventory Management for Tools, Equipment, and Supplies**: 
Addressing the management of medical and non-medical inventory, including tracking, ordering, and usage monitoring. We'll explore how to create a system that ensures supplies are adequately stocked and tools and equipment are maintained and available when needed.

### 5. **Integration and Data Flow Between Modules**: 
Considering how different modules (such as resource scheduling, patient tracking, and inventory management) will interact and share data. This topic will delve into designing an integrated system architecture that supports efficient data exchange and provides a cohesive user experience across the clinic's operations.



The application leverages features and modules to facilitate the process of Operating Room (OR) management.

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** The Strategy Pattern allows the behavior of an application to be selected at runtime. Similarly, RBAC allows the permissions for users to be dynamically determined based on their role, enabling different strategies for access control to be applied based on user roles.
2. **Reservation Request Module:** The State Pattern allows users to request reservations for blocks of OR time. The system then processes these requests, checks for availability, and confirms or denies the reservation based on predefined criteria.

3. **Approvals Workflow:** This can be closely related to the **Chain of Responsibility Pattern**. The Chain of Responsibility Pattern passes requests along a chain of handlers. In an approvals workflow, requests (e.g., for leave, expenses, or document approval) are passed through a series of approval stages or handlers, each potentially altering the request's state or adding information before passing it to the next handler in the chain.
